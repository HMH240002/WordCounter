# WordCounter
This java program reads words from a text file, prints them in order, then counts and lists words starting with "s" (Case-insensitive).

# Key Points:
Handles any number of words from the input file.
Uses recursive methods for printing and counting.
Treats both s and S as matches.


Usage:

# Compile
javac Lab18_2B.java

# Run
java Lab18_2B <input-file.txt>

Drop the .java and input file into the same directory, compile, and run. Check the console for the printed words and count results.
